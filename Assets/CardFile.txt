In a player's Buy phase, when the playercan buy a card, the player can buy an Event instead. Buying an Eventmeans paying the cost indicated on the Event and then doing the effectof the Event.The Event just stays on the table, the player does not takeit; there is no way for a player to gain one or end up with one in hisdeck. Buying an Event uses up a Buy; normally a player can either buya card, or buy an Event.A player with two Buys, such as after playing Ranger, could buy two cards, or buy two Events, or buy a card and an Event(in either order).The same Event can be bought multiple times in a turn if the player has the Buys and available to do it.Some Events give + Buys and so let the player buy further cards/ Events afterwards. Players cannot play further Treasures that turn after buying an Event. Buying an Event is not buying a card and so does not trigger cards like Swamp Hag or Goons(from Prosperity).Costs of Events are not affected by cards like Bridge Troll.","Cost":0,"ID":31124,"myCardTypes":[],"ExpID":17,"SubText":"","PotionCost":0,"DebtCost":0},{"CardName":"Merchant Guild","RulesText":"+1 Buy\n+ $1\n_______________\nWhile this is in play, when you buy a card, +1 coffers.","Cost":5,"ID":86691,"myCardTypes":[0],"ExpID":7,"SubText":"","PotionCost":0,"DebtCost":0},{"CardName":"Bureaucrat","RulesText":"Gain a Silver onto your deck.
